# Mobile Phone Financing System

This project demonstrates a mobile phone financing system where a client pays 40% of the cash price of the phone upfront and the financing company pays 60%. The financed amount is paid in weekly installments with interest, depending on the repayment period.

## Project Overview

The client pays a percentage of the mobile phone's price upfront, and the remaining amount is financed by the company. The repayment period varies, and different interest rates are applied depending on how long the client takes to repay the loan.

### Example:
- **Cash Price**: Ksh 100,000
- **Client Payment**: 40% (Ksh 40,000)
- **Financed Amount**: 60% (Ksh 60,000)

The client will repay the financed amount over 12 weeks with interest. Depending on the repayment period, the interest rate varies:

- **4 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.3
- **8 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.4
- **12 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.5
- **16 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.6
- **20 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.7
- **24 Weeks**: Interest Rate = 1.8

## How It Works

1. The client pays 40% of the mobile phone price upfront.
2. The remaining 60% is financed by the company.
3. The repayment period can vary, and the interest rate increases based on the number of weeks the client takes to repay.
4. Weekly payments are calculated based on the financed amount and the interest rate applied.
